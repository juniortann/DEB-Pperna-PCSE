# Mussel culture assessment in the South of Brazil

Data and code used for the article ["Assessing bivalve growth using bio-energetic models"](https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1fkoN15DJ-5f1a). Mussel growth assessment throughout the brazilian Southeastern coast using the Dynamic Energy Budget theory. 

![Graphical Abstract](GraphicalAbstract.png "Graphical Abstract")

- Remote sensing data has the prefix **NC**, and processing code are within the NCtools.py file
- Parameter estimation for the brown mussel *Perna perna* is in the folder with the species name. Files are to be used in the [DEBtool](https://github.com/add-my-pet/DEBtool_M) program for Matlab. Resulting parameters are found in the **results_Perna_perna.mat** file. 
- Actual processing was done using the files with prefix **Run**, as well as the available IPython notebooks included in this repository. Mathematical description of the code is provided in the published manuscript.
